# Python Challenge

This challenge utilizes python script to analyze two seperate csv files by apply concepts recently learned.

A new repository for the project was created for the project. The repository was cloned to my local computer.
Two folders wre created in the repository with the names "PyBank" and "PyPoll." Additional folders were created for the source data and the output from the assignment. 
All changes to the files are pushed up to the python-challenge Repository.


PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of our company. We are given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

We will create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Instructions

In this Challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I am given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
